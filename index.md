### Course Description
This course provides an introduction to how networks underly our social, technological, and natural worlds, with an emphasis on developing intuitions for broadly applicable concepts in network analysis. The course will include: an introduction to graph theory and graph concepts; social networks; information networks; the aggregate behavior of markets and crowds; network dynamics; information diffusion; the implications of popular concepts such as "six degrees of separation", the "friendship paradox", and the "wisdom of crowds".

### Syllabus Details
#### Learning goals

Understand basic graph theory and network analysis

Understand basic game theory and strategic behavior

Develop a quantitative and qualitative intuition for the role of networks in social and technological systems.

#### Prerequisites

Almost no mathematical knowledge is assumed other than some basic probability (random variables, expectation, independence), which we will briefly review when it first arises.

#### Material

Easley and Kleinberg, Networks, Crowds, and Markets, Cambridge University Press, 2010
The complete textbook is available online as a free PDF, but can also be ordered as a reasonably priced hardcover.

#### Problem Set Rules
1. All problem sets are to be submitted during the corresponding lecture day. 
2. Collaboration policy: You may discuss the problem sets with other students in the class, but since the goal is to practice skills, the actual writing up of the solutions must be done separately. In particular, this means that your solution should not word-for-word resemble another student's. In short, students are expected to abide by UCAS’s honor code.
3. Late Policy: No late assignments will be accepted.
4. Extreme circumstances: email or come see me, I am a reasonable human being.
